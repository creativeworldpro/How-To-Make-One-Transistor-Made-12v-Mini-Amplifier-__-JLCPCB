An amplifier is an electronic device, that can increase the power of signal, voltage and current.
An amplifier produces an output that is larger than the input signal. That means, an amplifier is an electrical device that makes sounds louder & clear.
In this project, we are going to teach you making a simple amplifier circuit. 
You can operate this circuit using only DC-12v and only 3 type electronics component.



To make this circuit, we need – 


1. Transistor – D 718
2. Capacitor – 470µf/ 35v
3.Resistor – 1 KΩ

4. Power Source - DC 12v
5. Sound Speaker



Transistor Pinout – 

As usual all transistor have 3 legs. This 3 legs have different names. If we count this leg from left side, then 1st  Bass, 2nd Collector & 3rd Emitter.
D 718 is an NPN transistor.


Circuit Connection – 

1st we connect 25v capacitor negative leg with “Bass” of transistor. Then we connect 1kΩ resistor with “Bass” & “Emitter” of transistor.
Now we connect audio input cable with the circuit. Connect audio input “R” cable with capacitor positive leg and connect audio input “G” cable with “Collector” of transistor. 


Now we need to connect Speaker and Power source with the circuit. 1st we connect DC-12v positive cable with speaker. Then connect speaker other terminal with “Emitter” of transistor. Now we connect DC-12v negative cable with “Collector” of transistor.

Your circuit is now ready for use. Just plug-in power, connect audio input cable with audio source. Then enjoy the music.
